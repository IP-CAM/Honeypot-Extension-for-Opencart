# Honeypot

## Description
**Honeypot** is an OpenCart extension designed to prevent spambots from registering new accounts, leaving messages or reviews, etc. Unlike traditional CAPTCHAs, which hinder user experience (UX) by interrupting and slowing down the customer journey, Honeypot is invisible to customers and requires no action from them.  
Compatible with OpenCart 3.x versions.
